# Landing Zone

We recommend creating a “Landing Zone” for your AWS organization, which
provides a starting place for AWS access as well as a baseline for
account architecture.

You can read more about the landing zone concept in AWS’s [Prescriptive
Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/strategy-migration/aws-landing-zone.html).
