#### Accessing another GitHub repository

If for any reason, your workflow needs to access another GitHub
repository different than its source, for example:

1.  Pulling application code from CodeBuild, or

2.  Pulling manifests from a separate repo than the application code.

In these cases, the CI/CD workflow will require a Personal Access Token
with the correct permissions set as a secret in the workflow source.

##### To generate a personal access token (PAT)

1.  Sign in as the CI GitHub user (stored in GitHub)

2.  Access `Settings` via the user picture dropdown in the upper right
    corner

3.  From the left navigation menu, access `<> Developer settings`(all
    the way at the bottom at time of writing)

4.  From the left navigation menu in `Developer settings`, access
    Personal Access Token
    
    1.  If presented with a dropdown, select `Tokens (classic)`

5.  You may now generate a new PAT with the `Generate new token` button
    above the list of PATs already in existence

6.  In the popup:
    
    1.  Notate the purpose of the token
    
    2.  Choose its expiration timeframe
    
    3.  Ensure that the token has the correct permissions by selecting
        the checkbox next to `repo`

    `secrets.NAME_OF_SECRET`
