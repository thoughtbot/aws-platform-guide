thoughtbot uses Terraform to provision resources on the cloud, like
databases, buckets, and DNS entries. We keep the Terraform configuration
for an organization in its [infrastructure
repository](../../conventions-and-expectations/repository-conventions/infrastructure-repository.md).
You can provision resources on the platform by submitting pull requests
to this repository.
