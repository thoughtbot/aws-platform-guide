                    <p>Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. Kubernetes consists of several components:</p><ul><li><p>An object store for declaring Kubernetes resources</p></li><li><p>The Kubernetes API, which allows clients to read and modify resources</p></li><li><p>Controllers, which are containers that use the Kubernetes API to watch and update resources and make changes to your infrastructure to reflect resources</p></li><li><p>The Kubelet, which runs containers on nodes</p></li></ul><h2 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-ControllersandResources">Controllers and Resources</h2><p>Developers create Kubernetes resources to describe how their application should run in the cloud. Kubernetes controllers watch these resources to make infrastructure reflect these resources.</p><p>Controllers can create or modify other resources based on the resources they watch or they can make actual changes to your cloud infrastructure to bring your declarations to life.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/11173974/112623722.png" data-image-src="attachments/11173974/112623722.png" data-height="524" data-width="1170" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="112623722" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Kubernetes-Controllers.drawio (1).png" data-base-url="https://thoughtbot.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="11173974" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="06379746-ac26-40b4-a81c-76ac4e742c29" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><p>This the above diagram, one controller watches deployments and creates a new replica set for each revision to the deployment. Another controller watches replica sets and creates pods to for each replica set.</p><h2 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-CoreResources">Core Resources</h2><p>There are a few core Kubernetes resources that you'll interact with as a developer. Kubernetes includes controllers to manage all these resources for you, so all you need to do is declare which resources you need to run your services.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/11173974/113377326.png" data-image-src="attachments/11173974/113377326.png" data-height="1262" data-width="1442" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="113377326" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Kubernetes-Core Resources.drawio.png" data-base-url="https://thoughtbot.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="11173974" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="1f349ea8-8b63-4c7c-b47f-766fd6dc3ef1" data-media-type="file"></span><p /><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-Pods">Pods</h3><p>Pods are the core compute resource in a Kubernetes cluster. A pod is a tightly coupled group of containers working together to provide one unit of work. Some pods may consist of only one container. One example of a pod would be a single instance of a web worker responding to user web requests. In order to fulfill production traffic, you would run several web pods. A pod is similar to a dyno from Heroku.</p><p>Kubernetes resources have labels, which are strings that describe the role of a resource. For example, your web pods might have a <code>component</code> label with a value of <code>web</code>.</p><p>Pods declare a list of containers that will run to complete their work alongside configuration necessary to run those containers. A minimal container definition includes a container image used to create containers in the cluster.</p><p>Pods can also declare ports that will be exposed from their containers. For example, your web pod might declare an <code>http</code> port listening on port <code>8080</code>.</p><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-Services">Services</h3><p>A service groups pods together to fulfill a common purpose.</p><p>Services find pods based on their labels and optionally describe service ports which will be routed to the appropriate port on each pod.</p><p>A web service could select pods with a <code>component</code> label of <code>web</code> and declare the port <code>80</code> for the service will route to port <code>8080</code> on its pods.</p><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-Deployments">Deployments</h3><p>While a service describe which pods will be used to fulfill a common need, a deployment describes how those pods will run.</p><p>A deployment includes labels that will be used to determine which pods it will control as well as a pod template which will be used to create pods for the deployment. A deployment can also declare how many pods will run in order to fulfill requests for the service.</p><p>A web deployment would select pods using the <code>component</code> label of <code>web</code> and include a pod template with the container image for your application as well as any necessary configuration, such as environment variables or volumes.</p><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-ReplicaSets">Replica Sets</h3><p>Each time you modify a deployment, a replica set will be created based on that revision of the deployment. Each time a new replica set is created, it will gradually create pods based on the deployment's revised pod template until the desired number of pods is created.</p><p>Each replica set becomes obsolete when a new replica set is created for its deployment. Once a replica set is obsolete, it will slowly terminate its pods as the new replica set becomes ready until no pods are running for the old replica set.</p><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-ConfigMaps">Config Maps</h3><p>Config maps can be used to declare environment variables or files that can be mounted in a container. You can create a config map and then use it from several deployments. Config maps are used for non-sensitive information.</p><h3 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-Secrets">Secrets</h3><p>Secrets work just like config maps except that they're designed to store sensitive information like passwords. Secrets are mounted as environment variables or files but can have different permissions based on their sensitive nature.</p><h2 id="IntroductiontoKubernetes-Manifests">Manifests</h2><p>To create these resources in a Kubernetes cluster, developers usually author <a href="Authoring-Kubernetes-Manifests_11305066.html" data-linked-resource-id="11305066" data-linked-resource-version="4" data-linked-resource-type="page">Kubernetes manifests</a> in a Git repository which is automatically applied to the cluster by a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
